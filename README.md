# swsbookingsystem
A Queen’s University Computer Engineering capstone project (Group 26, 2021-2022)

Queen’s University’s Student Wellness Services (SWS) supports the personal, academic, and social health development of students through their services with the goal of being responsive to health and wellness needs. One such service is booking an appointment with a physician at the clinic for non-emergency situations. While many students reap the benefits of this, there are challenges in the booking process that inhibit SWS from accomplishing their goal of being optimally responsive to students, primarily due to limited booking hours and long queuing times. From a staff perspective, the system has flaws as well – it requires manual scheduling, email reminders for appointments, sending paperwork, etc.

To reduce inefficiencies and help SWS better achieve their goal of supporting Queen’s students’ health, Group 26’s capstone project aims to redesign the SWS appointment booking system. The new system will automatically schedule students an appointment with the appropriate type of physician. Additionally, it will automate the manual work currently being done by Queen’s administers.
